## Project Background

Nowadays, a lot of people spend most of their time in front of a screen. This could lead to increased risk in optical health, which are usually overlooked by most people. 

According to PERDAMI (Perhimpunan Dokter Spesialis Mata Indonesia), there are only 3000+ eye-specialists in the country, relative to the 270 million citizens

An inaccessible medical care system means that as of today, it is becoming more difficult to receive required medical consultation regarding the health and condition of our eyes.
